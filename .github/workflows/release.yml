            ## Installation Instructions (macOS - Unsigned)
            
            ⚠️ **Important**: This app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate.
            
            **Platform**: Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) only - Intel Macs are not currently supported
            
            ### How to install:
            1. Download the `.dmg` file below
            2. Open the DMG and drag the app to Applications
            3. **First time only**: Right-click the app → Select "Open" → Click "Open" again
            4. macOS will remember your choice and you can open normally afterward
